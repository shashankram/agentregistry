// DeploymentAdapter is the v1alpha1 runtime surface for deploying
// Agent or MCPServer targets onto a concrete runtime (Kubernetes,
// hosted cloud runtimes, etc.).
//
// One adapter per runtime type. Adapters are registered at app boot in
// a map keyed by Type() string; the reconciler looks up by
// Runtime.Spec.Type when a Deployment apply arrives.
//
// Lifecycle contract (see design-docs/V1ALPHA1_RUNTIME_ADAPTERS.md):
//
//  1. apply handler validates + resolves refs + Upserts the Deployment
//     row; reconciler observes NOTIFY.
//  2. reconciler calls DeploymentAdapter.Apply with the resolved
//     Target + Runtime objects.
//  3. Apply returns immediately with a Progressing condition. Adapter
//     spawns its own watch loop to later PatchStatus with Ready=True
//     when the workload converges.
//  4. on Deployment delete, Store.Delete sets DeletionTimestamp; the
//     reconciler calls DeploymentAdapter.Remove for external-state
//     teardown. Row lifetime is owned by soft-delete + GC, not by
//     adapter-returned tokens — Remove is purely an external-state
//     hook.
//
// Apply is ALWAYS ASYNC. Apply returns quickly; convergence is tracked
// via the adapter's own watch loop writing status. The reconciler
// doesn't block on convergence.
//
// Adapters with expensive Apply paths can also implement
// DeploymentDesiredFingerprinter to make unchanged reconciles cheap after the
// same resolved input has already been accepted. Adapters that can enumerate
// provider-observed workloads implement DeploymentDiscoverySource separately;
// discovery is intentionally opt-in and is not part of the lifecycle contract.
